  Although it is difficult to see the trend in happiness score for every nation at a glance, we can divide them up to continents 
  and see if there is a pattern. First, North and South America tends to keep up their happiness score above neutral. This is supported by 
  the choropleth visualization as most nations have bright green color throughout the years with exceptions like Venezuela. Venezuela has experienced
  a complex and multifaceted crisis that has resulted in significant economic, 
  social, and political collapse. The crisis has been building for several decades, but it intensified in the mid-2010s.
  <br><br>
  What about nations in Africa, Middle East, and Asia? These regions are more complex than South and North America. There are
  lot of nations with above average happiness score and lot of nations with below average happiness score. This shows a good example 
  of how proximity of nations may not contribute to the happiness level of a nation.
  <br><br>
  One take away from the visualization is that happiness score is more complex than we imagine. It's important to remember
  that a nation's well-being can be influenced by many factors, and these factors can change over time. 
  For instance, a country may experience a dip in their index score due to a temporary economic recession, 
  but with the right policies and investments, they could make a strong economic recovery in the years that follow,
  leading to an increase in their score. It's crucial to keep this in mind when interpreting these scores and making 
  judgments about a country's overall well-being. By taking into account the various contextual factors, we can gain 
  a more accurate and nuanced understanding of a nation's situation.
